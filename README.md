## How it works

We normalize your references.bib in a simple way! If this is your first time here, you may need to follow these steps:

**Step 1**: access Bibtex-normalizer via https://hsborges.github.io/bibtex-normalizer/


**Step 2**: you can normalize your references by loading your file at "Home" tab or paste your content on "Editor" tab.


**Step 3**: after an automatic normalization process, Bibtex-normalizer lists all of potential issues regarding Bibtex standards. Those issues may be one of the following:

* unnecesary fields
* missing fields from Bibtex entries
* unformatted fields regarding Bibtex standards


**Step 4**: edit your file online to fix those issues and click on "Normalize".


**Step 5**: with your normalized file, you can copy to your clipboard or save as a new Bibtex file (.bib).


## Define your own configuration
